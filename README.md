E-Register

This is my online attendance E-Register.

In this assignment we are trying to produce an attendance application using MVC and investigating aspects of Domain Modelling and Services.
On this application you should be able to create, edit and delete information on  students attendance to classes,.

Cloning

The first thing you need to do when cloning my github project is to use the "cd" command which will take you to the pc directory. Then you use the "git clone git@github.com:b1002980/e-Register.git" command.
