E-Register
=========

This is my online attendance E-Register.

This project is the second assignment for the SHU Web Architectures module.

In this assignment we are trying to produce an attendance application using MVC and investigating aspects of Domain Modelling and Services.
On this application you should be able to create, edit and delete information on  students attendance to classes,.

Cloning:

The first thing you need to do when cloning my github project is to use the "cd" command which will take you to the pc directory. Then you use the "git clone git@github.com:b1002980/e-Register.git" command.

Viewing the Application:

To be able to view my application you have to use the "grails run-app" command line in the terminal.

I have tried to commit things on a regular basis to provide a good account of what I have done but not go overboard and use a commit command after every minor entry to overwhelm the reader.
